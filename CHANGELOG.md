# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## ctor [0.12.0] - Unreleased

### Added

- Support for `#[ctor]` on `impl` items. To be valid, the `fn` must have no
  `self` parameter and must not access any generic parameters from the outer
  item.
- Added `life before main` documentation to all crates.
- `early` and `late` priority values are now supported on all platforms.

### Removed

- deprecated `dtor` feature and crate dependency from `ctor` crate (use the `dtor` crate directly).

### Changed

- If the `priority` feature is enabled, `ctor` priority sorting is now stable
  and consistent across platforms: `early`/`0`/`unspecified`, then `1 <= N <
  1000`, then `late`.
- If a `link_section` or `export_name_prefix` is specified, a `priority` value
  must not be specified (now a compiler error).

## dtor [0.12.0] - Unreleased
