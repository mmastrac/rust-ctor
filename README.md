Module initialization/teardown functions for Rust (like
`__attribute__((constructor))` in C/C++) for Linux, OSX, FreeBSD, NetBSD,
Illumos, OpenBSD, DragonFlyBSD, Android, iOS, WASM, and Windows.

This library currently requires **Rust > 1.31.0** at a minimum for the
procedural macro support.

## Zero Dependency

As of `ctor 0.3.0+`, `ctor` has no dependencies. The proc macro in this crate
inlines a helper declarative macro that does the majority of the work.

## Support

This library works and [is regularly tested](https://travis-ci.org/mmastrac/rust-ctor)
on Linux, OSX and Windows, with both `+crt-static` and `-crt-static`. Other platforms are supported
but not tested as part of the automatic builds. This library will also work as expected in both
`bin` and `cdylib` outputs, ie: the `ctor` and `dtor` will run at executable or library
startup/shutdown respectively.

This library supports WASM targets, but note that only a single `#[ctor]` function is
supported due to platform limitations.

## Linking

The `#[ctor]` and `#[dtor]` macros make use of linker sections to ensure that a
function is run at startup time.

Because of various platform linking issues, you may need to ensure that you
reference a symbol in each module that provides a `#[ctor]` or `#[dtor]`. If the
functions do not run as expected, `use other_crate` may be sufficient to fix
things.

See https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/133491 for more information.

## Warnings

Rust's philosophy is that nothing happens before or after main and
this library explicitly subverts that. The code that runs in the `ctor`
and `dtor` functions should be careful to limit itself to `libc`
functions and code that does not rely on Rust's stdlib services.

For example, using stdout in a `dtor` function is a guaranteed panic. Consider
using the [`libc-print` crate](https://crates.io/crates/libc-print) for output
to stderr/stdout during `#[ctor]` and `#[dtor]` methods. Other issues
may involve signal processing or panic handling in that early code.

In most cases, `sys_common::at_exit` is a better choice than `#[dtor]`. Caveat emptor!

On some platforms, unloading of shared libraries may not actually
happen until process exit, even if explicitly unloaded. The rules for
this are arcane and difficult to understand. For example, thread-local
storage on OSX will affect this (see [this comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/28794#issuecomment-368693049)).

## Examples

Marks the function `foo` as a module constructor, called when a static
library is loaded or an executable is started:

```rust
    static INITED: AtomicBool = AtomicBool::new(false);

    #[ctor]
    fn foo() {
        INITED.store(true, Ordering::SeqCst);
    }
```

Creates a `HashMap` populated with strings when a static
library is loaded or an executable is started (new in `0.1.7`):

```rust
    #[ctor]
    /// This is an immutable static, evaluated at init time
    static STATIC_CTOR: HashMap<u32, &'static str> = {
        let mut m = HashMap::new();
        m.insert(0, "foo");
        m.insert(1, "bar");
        m.insert(2, "baz");
        m
    };
```

Print a message at shutdown time. Note that Rust may have shut down
some stdlib services at this time.

```rust
    #[dtor]
    unsafe fn shutdown() {
        // Using println or eprintln here will panic as Rust has shut down
        libc::printf("Shutting down!\n\0".as_ptr() as *const i8);
    }
```

## Under the Hood

The `#[ctor]` macro makes use of linker sections to ensure that a
function is run at startup time.

The above example translates into the following Rust code (approximately):

```rust
    #[used]
    #[cfg_attr(any(target_os = "linux", target_os = "android"), link_section = ".init_array")]
    #[cfg_attr(target_os = "freebsd", link_section = ".init_array")]
    #[cfg_attr(target_os = "netbsd", link_section = ".init_array")]
    #[cfg_attr(target_os = "openbsd", link_section = ".init_array")]
    #[cfg_attr(target_vendor = "apple", link_section = "__DATA,__mod_init_func")]
    #[cfg_attr(target_os = "windows", link_section = ".CRT$XCU")]
    static FOO: extern fn() = {
        #[cfg_attr(any(target_os = "linux", target_os = "android"), link_section = ".text.startup")]
        extern fn foo() { /* ... */ };
        foo
    };
```

The `#[dtor]` macro effectively creates a constructor that calls `libc::atexit` with the provided function, ie roughly equivalent to:

```rust
    #[ctor]
    fn dtor_atexit() {
        libc::atexit(dtor);
    }
```
